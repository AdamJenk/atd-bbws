Building Block Template . 
===================

This is a skeleton building block which can be used to create new ones.  

It's a basic building block but contains some intermediate to advanced concepts, so if
you're looking for somewhere to start with Building Block development, it may not be the best place to start.

By default it includes
* the Stripes framework
* Spring Dependancy Injection (not fully implemented yet, but the dependencies are there)


Creating a new Project
------------

1. Get the template project:  
````git clone https://github.com/AllTheDucks/atd-b2-stub.git myproject````  
where ````myproject```` is the name of your project.
1. Change into the project directory: ````cd myproject````
1. Run the initB2 task and enter all the details: ````gradlew initB2```` 
1. Change the git repository for your new project: ````git remote set-url origin <git url>````

**DONE !**
